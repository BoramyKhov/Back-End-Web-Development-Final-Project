# Back-End Web Development Final Project (HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PHP/SQL/JQuery/AJAX)

# Bakery Website 

Notice: There is only one submission/commit for this GitHub. This is because most of the work was done offline and shared in other ways. Most of the time spent on this project was spent testing features, implementing them individually, and then integrating them into our final project.

# Responsibilities and Work (Tasks)

## Interactive Promotional Features: A collaborative effort (Boramy + Khim)

## Menu Search Function: Boramy 

## Cake Customizer: Khim 

## FAQ Bot or Chat Bot: Boramy

## Database (ERD): Boramy

## Login and Validation: Khim 

Note: While these are our responsibilities, there was cooperation between both of us in assisting one another, and it was a team effort to complete the project.
